## Joining a MultiWorld Game

If you want to be a part of a multiworld, the first thing you're gonna have to do is make a YAML file for the game. The archipelago launcher should have a button labled "generate template options". If you hit that, it should create default YAMLs for the apworlds you have installed and automatically open up your YAML templates folder. Find kingdom_hearts_MoM_manual in there and edit it to your hearts content. Once that's done, either put it in your archipelago/plyaers folder, or send it to whoever is generating the multiworld (details on this in the archipelago setup).

Once the game is generated and hosted, you should be given a server room link (and likely port number). Once you have that, just open up the manual client from within the archipelago launcher and make sure kingdom_hearts_MoM_manual is selected as the game. In the text box at the bottom, type "/connect <the link you were given> <your chosen player name>" then hit enter! You should be good to play now!
